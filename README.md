# ⛓️ Blockchain for Algorithms with Proof of Work (PoW)  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project implements a **blockchain-based system** in **Go (Golang)** where network members accept **algorithms and data** from clients, execute them, and store the results as **transactions** in a blockchain. The **Proof of Work (PoW)** mechanism ensures computational integrity and security, similar to **Bitcoin's consensus model**.  

## 🎯 Key Features  
✅ **Decentralized Algorithm Execution** – Nodes execute user-submitted algorithms.  
✅ **Proof of Work (PoW) Consensus** – Secures the network and prevents spam.  
✅ **Immutable Blockchain Storage** – Stores executed results as verified transactions.  
✅ **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Networking** – Nodes communicate in a decentralized manner.  
✅ **Bitcoin-Like Mechanism** – Blocks, mining, rewards, and transaction verification.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Language**: Go (Golang)  
- **Cryptographic Hashing**: SHA-256 for secure transactions  
- **P2P Networking**: Decentralized node communication  
- **Blockchain Storage**: Go-based ledger system  
- **Concurrency**: Goroutines for efficient execution  

## 🔧 How It Works  
1. **Client Submits Algorithm & Data**  
   - The client sends an algorithm and its input data to the blockchain network.  
2. **Network Nodes Execute the Algorithm**  
   - Nodes compete to execute the algorithm and generate a valid result.  
3. **Proof of Work (PoW) Validation**  
   - Nodes must solve a cryptographic challenge before adding the result as a transaction.  
4. **Block Creation & Mining**  
   - The validated result is stored in a new block and mined into the blockchain.  
5. **Transaction Finalization**  
   - Once verified, the transaction becomes part of the immutable blockchain.  

## 🚀 Installation & Usage  
### Prerequisites  
- **Go (Golang)** installed  
- **Crypto and networking libraries**  

### Steps  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BlockChain-For-Algorithms-With-POW.git
   cd BlockChain-For-Algorithms-With-POW
   ```  
2. Build and run the blockchain node:  
   ```bash
   go build main.go  
   ./main  
   ```  
3. Submit an algorithm and input data through the client interface.  

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
